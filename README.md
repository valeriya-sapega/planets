### Challenge:
- Apply new knowledge of TypeScript
- Practice prop-drilling using useState
- Use SCSS styles for the app
  
### Personal Achievement:
- Used TypeScript on a real-life app
- Implemented child-parent inheritance without using Router components, Context API, and reducers for a better understanding of prop-drilling pros and *(mostly)* cons
- Learned SCSS basics
